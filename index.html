        <p>Hello welcome to shogifacts.com where I share all of the news and strats for the greatest strategy game. I am myself a novice and enthusiast in the game and have been for a number of years.  I first learned of the game from the character Shikamaru Nara from Naruto. I looked up the game and how it was played and I was interested in the aesthetic of the boards and pieces as well as the depth of strategy. I found that there is a very steep learning curve which is compounded by a lack of resources in English. Here I will try to share what information I can to alleviate this.</p>
